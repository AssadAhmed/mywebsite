# The Bechdel Test

https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/

The [Bechdel test](https://bechdeltest.com) is a way to assess how women are depicted in Hollywood movies.  In order for a movie to pass the test:

1. It has to have at least two [named] women in it
2. Who talk to each other
3. About something besides a man

```{r read_data}

bechdel <- read_csv(here::here("data", "bechdel.csv")) %>% 
  mutate(test = factor(test)) 
glimpse(bechdel)
head(bechdel)
```

How many films fail/pass the test, both as a number and as a %?

```{r}
#Count how many films pass/fail the test

pass_fail <- bechdel %>% 
  #filter out any NA's in the test column, exclude these films form the stats
  filter(!is.na(test)) %>% 
  #select the test,count, percent columns
  select(test) %>% 
  #mutate to add a count column
  mutate(count = n(),
         percent= count/sum(count)) %>%
  #group by test & summarise
  group_by(test) %>% 
  summarise(count = sum(count),
            percent=sum(percent))

#view the results
pass_fail
  
```


## Movie scores
```{r}
ggplot(data = bechdel, aes(
  x = metascore,
  y = imdb_rating,
  colour = test
)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .3, size = 3) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("tomato", "olivedrab")) +
  labs(
    x = "Metacritic score",
    y = "IMDB rating",
    colour = "Bechdel test"
  ) +
 theme_light()
```


# Split the data
```{r}
# **Split the data**

set.seed(123)

data_split <- initial_split(bechdel, # updated data
                           prop = 0.8, 
                           strata = test)

bechdel_train <- training(data_split) 
bechdel_test <- testing(data_split)
```

Check the counts and % (proportions) of the `test` variable in each set.
```{r}

#calculate stats for training set
train_stats <- bechdel_train %>% 
  #filter out any NA's in the test column, exclude these films form the stats
  filter(!is.na(test)) %>% 
  #select the test,count, percent columns
  select(test) %>% 
  #mutate to add a count column
  mutate(count = n(),
         percent= count/sum(count)) %>%
  #group by test & summarise
  group_by(test) %>% 
  summarise(count = sum(count),
            percent=sum(percent))

#calculate stats for test set
test_stats <- bechdel_test %>% 
  #filter out any NA's in the test column, exclude these films form the stats
  filter(!is.na(test)) %>% 
  #select the test,count, percent columns
  select(test) %>% 
  #mutate to add a count column
  mutate(count = n(),
         percent= count/sum(count)) %>%
  #group by test & summarise
  group_by(test) %>% 
  summarise(count = sum(count),
            percent=sum(percent))

#view the results
test_stats
train_stats

#the percentage pass/fail is ~the same for the train and testing data set.
```

## Feature exploration


```{r}

bechdel %>% 
  select(test, budget_2013, domgross_2013, intgross_2013, imdb_rating, metascore) %>% 

    pivot_longer(cols = 2:6,
               names_to = "feature",
               values_to = "value") %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x=test, y = value, fill = test)+
  coord_flip()+
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_wrap(~feature, scales = "free")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  labs(x=NULL,y = NULL)

```

## Scatterplot - Correlation Matrix

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
bechdel %>% 
  select(test, budget_2013, domgross_2013, intgross_2013, imdb_rating, metascore)%>% 
  ggpairs(aes(colour=test), alpha=0.2)+
  theme_bw()
```
Explaining the correlation matrix:
[colour references, fail=red and blue=pass.]

From the output we can see that films that failed the bechdel test has higher mean rating (imdb/meta score) and slightly higher domestic/international box office gross figures. The IMDB ratings for both pass/fail movies are normally distributed about the mean, which is similar for the meta score. The scatter plot also shows that IMDB rating and meta score are highly correlated (backed up by the ~0.7 correlation coefficient).
The strongest positive correlation appears to be between international and domestic boxoffice gross (almost 1!).

budget, domestic, and international gross all show significant kurtosis, with extreme right handed skewness visible (implying the majority of the films are towards the lower end of those variables).
1 very significant outliers appear to be visible, one for budget (extremely high value within the fail category).
Overall the pass/fail bedechel test categories appear to have very similar characteristics, with minor differences in the fail category leading to marginally higher mean box office and budget figures.

## Categorical variables


```{r}
bechdel %>% 
  group_by(genre, test) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n))
  
 
bechdel %>% 
  group_by(rated, test) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n))
```
genre summary:

Action has the highest failure rate c.70% of the genres with >10 movies.For example, Documentary has a 100% failure rate but only a sample size of 3 which is too small to draw conclusions from.
Horror on the other hand has the highest pass %, with 67% of all Horror films passing the bedechel test.
The generes with the largest number of films (Action, Comedy, drama, Horror) all show significant differences from the overall pass/fail %'s, highlighting significant differencess in the bedechel test outcomes based on the genre selected.

Ratings summary:

PG,PG-13, and R rated films all showcase similar behaviour to the overall sample in terms of the pass/fail %'s.
However, G & NC-17 exhibited markedly different results, with much higher % rates of failure than the average. Again this showcases that the pass/failure rate is influenced by the rating for those particular cases.

# Train first models. `test ~ metascore + imdb_rating`

```{r}
lr_mod <- logistic_reg() %>% 
  set_engine(engine = "glm") %>% 
  set_mode("classification")

lr_mod


tree_mod <- decision_tree() %>% 
  set_engine(engine = "C5.0") %>% 
  set_mode("classification")

tree_mod 
```

```{r}


lr_fit <- lr_mod %>% # parsnip model
  fit(test ~ metascore + imdb_rating, # a formula
    data = bechdel_train # dataframe
  )

tree_fit <- tree_mod %>% # parsnip model
  fit(test ~ metascore + imdb_rating, # a formula
    data = bechdel_train # dataframe
  )
```

## Logistic regression

```{r}
lr_fit %>%
  broom::tidy()

lr_preds <- lr_fit %>%
  augment(new_data = bechdel_train) %>%
  mutate(.pred_match = if_else(test == .pred_class, 1, 0))

```

### Confusion matrix

```{r}
lr_preds %>% 
  conf_mat(truth = test, estimate = .pred_class) %>% 
  autoplot(type = "heatmap")


```


## Decision Tree
```{r}
tree_preds <- tree_fit %>%
  augment(new_data = bechdel) %>%
  mutate(.pred_match = if_else(test == .pred_class, 1, 0)) 


```

```{r}
tree_preds %>% 
  conf_mat(truth = test, estimate = .pred_class) %>% 
  autoplot(type = "heatmap")
```

## Draw the decision tree

```{r}
draw_tree <- 
    rpart::rpart(
        test ~ metascore + imdb_rating,
        data = bechdel_train, # uses data that contains both birth weight and `low`
        control = rpart::rpart.control(maxdepth = 5, cp = 0, minsplit = 10)
    ) %>% 
    partykit::as.party()
plot(draw_tree)

```

# Cross Validation

Run the code below. What does it return?
The number of folds used for the model (i.e- how the model has been segmented, allows for corss validation with the training data split into equally sized folds)

```{r}
set.seed(123)
bechdel_folds <- vfold_cv(data = bechdel_train, 
                          v = 2, 
                          strata = test)
bechdel_folds
```

## `fit_resamples()`

Trains and tests a resampled model.

```{r}
lr_fit <- lr_mod %>%
  fit_resamples(
    test ~ metascore + imdb_rating,
    resamples = bechdel_folds
  )


tree_fit <- tree_mod %>%
  fit_resamples(
    test ~ metascore + imdb_rating,
    resamples = bechdel_folds
  )
```


## `collect_metrics()`

Unnest the metrics column from a tidymodels `fit_resamples()`
```{r}

collect_metrics(lr_fit)
collect_metrics(tree_fit)


```


```{r}
tree_preds <- tree_mod %>% 
  fit_resamples(
    test ~ metascore + imdb_rating, 
    resamples = bechdel_folds,
    control = control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE) #<<
  )

# What does the data for ROC look like?
tree_preds %>% 
  collect_predictions() %>% 
  roc_curve(truth = test, .pred_Fail)  

# Draw the ROC
tree_preds %>% 
  collect_predictions() %>% 
  roc_curve(truth = test, .pred_Fail) %>% 
  autoplot()

```


# Build a better training set with `recipes`

## Preprocessing options

- Encode categorical predictors
- Center and scale variables
- Handle class imbalance
- Impute missing data
- Perform dimensionality reduction 
- ... ...

## To build a recipe

1. Start the `recipe()`
1. Define the variables involved
1. Describe **prep**rocessing [step-by-step]

## Collapse Some Categorical Levels

Do we have any `genre` with few observations?  Assign genres that have less than 3% to a new category 'Other'


```{r}
#| echo = FALSE
bechdel %>% 
  count(genre) %>% 
  mutate(genre = fct_reorder(genre, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = genre, 
             y = n)) +
  geom_col(alpha = .8) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = NULL) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = (nrow(bechdel_train)*.03), lty = 3)+
  theme_light()
```


```{r}
movie_rec <-
  recipe(test ~ .,
         data = bechdel_train) %>%
  
  # Genres with less than 5% will be in a catewgory 'Other'
    step_other(genre, threshold = .03) 
```
  

## Before recipe

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE
bechdel_train %>% 
  count(genre, sort = TRUE)
```


## After recipe

```{r}
movie_rec %>% 
  prep() %>% 
  bake(new_data = bechdel_train) %>% 
  count(genre, sort = TRUE)
```

## `step_dummy()`

Converts nominal data into numeric dummy variables

```{r}
#| results = "hide"
movie_rec <- recipe(test ~ ., data = bechdel) %>%
  step_other(genre, threshold = .03) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) 

movie_rec 
```

## `step_novel()`

Adds a catch-all level to a factor for any new values not encountered in model training, which lets R intelligently predict new levels in the test set.

```{r}

movie_rec <- recipe(test ~ ., data = bechdel) %>%
  step_other(genre, threshold = .03) %>% 
  step_novel(all_nominal_predictors) %>% # Use *before* `step_dummy()` so new level is dummified
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) 

```


## `step_zv()`

Intelligently handles zero variance variables (variables that contain only a single value)

```{r}
movie_rec <- recipe(test ~ ., data = bechdel) %>%
  step_other(genre, threshold = .03) %>% 
  step_novel(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>% # Use *before* `step_dummy()` so new level is dummified
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>% 
  step_zv(all_numeric(), -all_outcomes()) 
  
```


## `step_normalize()`

Centers then scales numeric variable (mean = 0, sd = 1)

```{r}
movie_rec <- recipe(test ~ ., data = bechdel) %>%
  step_other(genre, threshold = .03) %>% 
  step_novel(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>% # Use *before* `step_dummy()` so new level is dummified
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>% 
  step_zv(all_numeric(), -all_outcomes())  %>% 
  step_normalize(all_numeric()) 

```


## `step_corr()`

Removes highly correlated variables

```{r}
movie_rec <- recipe(test ~ ., data = bechdel) %>%
  step_other(genre, threshold = .03) %>% 
  step_novel(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>% # Use *before* `step_dummy()` so new level is dummified
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>% 
  step_zv(all_numeric(), -all_outcomes())  %>% 
  step_normalize(all_numeric()) %>% 
  step_corr(all_predictors(), threshold = 0.75, method = "spearman") 

movie_rec
```


# Define different models to fit
